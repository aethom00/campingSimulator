							<p>
								This last week of development was spent making dilemmas on what to focus our time on. We wanted to add so many things,
								and in a camping simulator there is so much to add. In the end we decided to focus on adding audio for various features
								such as drinking, eating, the campfire, cooking food, collecting water, etc to help really immerse the player. We added
								a feature to refill and deplete the canteen where you can refill at the water filling station. You can now also put out
								the fire with the canteen! We also fixed some issues wiht the eating and drinking interactions. Followed by this we added
								a nature pavillion to explain some fun facts and proper eco-friendly camping practices. We also added inventory audio,
								increased the resolution of the inventory, added a Guidance UI (think quests) that try to align with the park ranger
								radio system, followed by checks for going to sleep, if you put the fire out, and if you put the food away. Beyond this,
								we also added and replaced dialogue for the park ranger radio system along with a queued system for the radio talking
								points as to avoid overlapping speaking points. One large bug we fixed was overlapping trigger boxes between the UI
								and first-time interaction events with the radio guide. Last of all, we also added fog with several kinds of plants
								(grass, ferns, poison ivy, etc). We make several more changes towards the paths (added more dirt paths) and modified
								the landscape.
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/trail.png" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/campsite.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>
								If given more time, we would liked to have finished so many more different features. There were features in mind like
								the spreading of a wildfire, more fish, a fishdex (think pokedex), a bear attack, and much much more. But there is only
								so much you can do in several weeks!
							</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/poisonIvy.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								As the developers of this game, we hope to teach any user whatever they need to feel confident going out into the
								wilderness to have a successful eco-friendly camping trip. We aimed to teach the user what you should consider eating,
								what you should consider drinking, safety practices regarding put away food for safety from animals, avoiding poison ivy,
								building fires, putting out fires, fishing, etc. We are hoping these new skills can help users think about how to be safe
								in the real world when camping and to build confidence towards possibly their first camping trip.

							<h3>Alpha Checkpoint</h3>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha_poisonivy.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								This third week of development was spent finishing boundaries on the navigable areas, adding gravel & dirt to the paths,
								added player status meters for hunger, thirst, and stamina, added the ability to cook food on the fire and eat it to
								restore health, allowing the user to drink from the cantene to restore thirst, placed poison ivy areas a little off the
								trails that reduce stamina if touched, scheduled and held an interview with our "stakeholder" Elly Maxwell, an entomologist
								at a public gardens and conservatory, added park ranger voice lines for the radio and queued them for several positions,
								refactored the dialogue manager, added a bear that roams the forest, made a way to hang up food in a tree (so the bear
								doesn't get it), and began development on other fish varieties to catch.
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha_statusbars.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha_bear.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha_cooking.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								The central idea we set had in this milestone was to teach the user that you need to eat, drink, put away food for safety
								from animals, avoid poison ivy, among other things. Past teachings included how to build a campfire and how to fish. We
								are hoping these new skills can help users think about how to be safe in the real world when camping and to build
								confidence towards possibly their first camping trip.
							</p>


							<p>
								We are again looking forward to the next milestone and we hope to finish adding more fish varieties, add badges/achievements,
								a Fishdex (similar to a Pokedex), the ability to refill safe drinking water, fire spreading, adding more lines for the radio
								guide, among other things.

							<h3>Milestone 2 Checkpoint</h3>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/milestone2.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								This second week of development was spent fixing bugs and adding lots of core camping functionality. This includes, but is
									not limited to animated water dripping from the canteen, confirmation dialog UI for exiting the game and going to sleep, creating paths within the landscape to increase ease of navigation, fixing the shadow and tent bugs, and recording voice acting lines for the Park Ranger radio guide, adding animated fire for
									the campfire, adding fishing with motion controls, importing a wide variety of fishable models (including a boot!), adding the
									inventory system and the ability to pull things out of it, fixing tree collisions, and adding the ability for lanterns to
									light up, and much more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unfortunately regarding the shadow bug, since Unreal 5.4.2 has a bug with shadows, we had to remove the shadows entirely.
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/m2_fishing.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
								So far the idea in this milestone is that we are teaching people how to build a campfire and how to fish, among many other skills.
								The hope is that the activities and fun facts in this simulator can be applied to the real world.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are again looking forward to the next milestone and we hope to finish the fishing functionality, add badges/achievements,
								a Fishdex (similar to a Pokedex), bears, fire spreading, the ability to store food, hunger, thirst, and to finish the
								functionality of the radio guide.

							<h3>Milestone 1 Checkpoint</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/milestone1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								This first week of development was spent brainstorming what interesting topics we might be able to pursue within our limitation of a few weeks of development.
									We went with the idea of a game / application that teaches good camping practices.
									Our progress so far is an inital mock-up of the camping scenery which includes a vast landscape with trees, mountains, and a small lake with a dock on the side.
									We've added a few interactions that the player is able to do like picking up branches and starting a fire, as well as skipping time using the tent.
									So far time passes constantly and we're trying to tie this into interactions in a way that interacting with things and progressing in learning about tasks speeds up the time a little.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/m1_01.jpeg" alt=""/><p>credits to Shawn for the drawing</p></span>
							<p>
								Overall the idea of this camping application seeks to allow and educate people unable to access more remote locations and experience camping for themselves.
								We hope this can be an enjoyable and interesting experience that shines some light on the practices of camping.
							</p>
							<p>
								Looking forward to the next milestone, we hope to further develop the environment of the campsite and expand upon the interactions a player is able to do.
								We also plan on adding a sort of guide / tutorial system that will teach the player about camping practices and tips.
